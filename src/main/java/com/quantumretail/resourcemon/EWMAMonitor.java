/**
 * Wraps another ResourceMonitor and calculates an exponentially-weighted moving average.
 *
 * This smooths some of the volatility in values, at the expense of quick response to changes.
 * It works by decreasing the weighting for each older data points exponentially, therefore favoring newer entries.
 * By picking the "halflife" of old entries, you can decide how much to favor new entries .
 *
 * One advantage of the EWMA approach is that we only need to keep the most recent value, instead of all previous entries.
